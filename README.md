# gtk_window

This package is a fork and re-work of the awesome [gtk_window](https://github.com/YoussefLasheen/gtk_window) by Youssef Lasheen. The package has been re-worked for personal usage, and has diverged a lot from the original. Significant changes include re-positioning the buttons on MacOS (although it is not tested), adding color customizations, context menus, and other goodies.

## License

The package maintains the original's package license which is MPL 2.0.
